I want to setup a simple website includes a chatbox for demo that written in typscript:

1. Root folder should have package.json:
    - using yarn command instead of npm
    - should have 2 workspaces that are frontend and server
    - should have common dependencies such as typescript, prettier, ts-node...etc
    - should setup prettier file with most common config
    - should have tsconfig file with most common config

2. Its folder structure:
    app/
    ├── frontend/
    ├── server/
    ├── shared/
    ├── package.json
    ├── yarn.lock
    ├── tsconfig.json
    ├── .prettierrc

3. Frontend folder should have:
    - Based on React and start on port 3000
    - Chatbox UI:
        + The is input field for user enter text
        + Above the input field is display box which will display inputted text from user
        + The right handside of the input field is a send button
    - Chatbox behaviours:
        + When user enter a text, and click on send button (or press enter key from the keyboard)
        + Then the inputted should be shown to the display box
        + And The input field should clear the inputted text as well

4. Server folder should have:
    - Based on express and start on port 5000
    - There is data.txt file
    - Server behaviours:
        + Anytime user send a text successfully, the server will capture the inputted text and save that to data.txt file
